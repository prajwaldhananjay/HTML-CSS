This is a basic Hotel Website!

It has three pages: index, about and contact. 

Remember to have a theme for your website. Use the same styling for buttons and links. Save similar styling
as utilities so that you can reuse them instead of coding again.
-> Also take a min or two to visualize the website first according to the ui design.
-> Make note of elements which can be given the same class to make styling easy. 

We've also made the site resposive to mobile devices.
